# The Quest for the perfect Quest

## Introduction: a design quest-ion
Hello there.   
Im Carlos, game develop student, and former leader of the amateur DuckDev team.   
I have done some little research work for my project, and I think i'm ready to share my new acquired knowledge.   
Let's talk about the Quest managing in videogames   
Quest managing is a constant interrogant in gamedev forums. There's a lot of questions about quest managing, and even worse: there's a lot of answers. We have no magical algorithm of how to make the perfect quest system, as the needs of each game are different.  
I have prepared a little tutorial of my approach to this problem. Although It only covers a very specific scenario, the great advantage (I guess) of the system I've built is it's scalability: you can expand it to reach every field you need for your game.  
Let's stop talking. Let's start working.
